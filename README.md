** Rebbus Project - Bus Data Scraping and Streamlit Application **

**Overview**

The Rebbus Project is my first venture into web scraping, focusing on extracting bus travel data from the Redbus website. The scraped data is then imported into a database, and a Streamlit app is built for dynamic filtering and visualization of this data. This project showcases the integration of web scraping, database management, and interactive data presentation through a web application.

**Skills Gained**

During this project, I developed and applied the following skills:

* Web Scraping with Selenium
* Python Programming
* Database Management with SQL
* Building Interactive Web Applications with Streamlit
  
**Problem Statement**

**Objective**

The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" project aims to provide a streamlined and efficient method for collecting and displaying bus travel data. By using Selenium, the project automates the process of scraping detailed information from the Redbus website, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The primary goal is to present this data in an easy-to-navigate Streamlit application, allowing users to dynamically filter and explore the information.

**Project Scope**

The scope of this project is focused on collecting and displaying bus data within a Streamlit application. The application allows users to filter the scraped data based on various parameters such as route, price, and availability. The current scope does not extend to advanced data analysis, but it lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as real-time updates, market analysis, and customer service tools.

**Features**

**Data Collection:** Automated web scraping using Selenium to gather bus routes, schedules, prices, and availability from the Redbus website.
**Data Storage:** The scraped data is stored in a SQL database for easy retrieval and management.
**Streamlit Application:** An interactive web app built with Streamlit that allows users to filter and explore the bus data dynamically.

**Potential Applications**

Although the current project is limited to displaying bus data in a Streamlit app, the underlying solution has various potential applications, including:

**Travel Aggregators:** Offering real-time bus schedules and seat availability.
**Market Analysis:** Analyzing travel patterns and customer preferences.
**Customer Service:** Providing customized travel options based on data insights.
**Competitor Analysis:** Comparing pricing and service levels with competitors.

**Conclusion**

The Rebbus Project is an important step in learning how to automate data collection and present it in an interactive format. The successful integration of web scraping, SQL, and Streamlit demonstrates the potential of using these technologies together to solve real-world problems, especially in the transportation industry. This project serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as adding real-time data updates and advanced analytics features.
